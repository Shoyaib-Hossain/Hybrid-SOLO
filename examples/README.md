## üìñ How to Use These Examples

### Step 1: Read the Code
Each example is heavily commented. Read through the entire file first to understand what it does.

### Step 2: Run the Example
Execute the example and observe the output:
```bash
python3 examples/01_hello_world.py
```

### Step 3: Experiment
Modify the code and see what happens:
- Change values
- Add new features
- Break things and fix them

### Step 4: Complete Exercises
Each example has exercises at the bottom. Try to complete them!

## üéì Learning Path

Follow this order if you're new to programming:

1. **01_hello_world.py** - Start here!
2. **03_database_example.py** - Learn about data storage
3. **02_simple_flask_app.py** - Build your first web app
4. **05_flask_with_forms.py** - Handle user input
5. **04_api_example.py** - Communicate with other services

## üí° Tips for Learning

### For Each Example:
1. **Read** the entire code first
2. **Run** it without modifications
3. **Understand** what each part does
4. **Modify** small parts
5. **Experiment** freely
6. **Complete** the exercises

### Debugging Tips:
- Add `print()` statements to see variable values
- Read error messages carefully - they tell you what's wrong
- Google error messages - others have had the same problems
- Use the Python debugger (`import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`)

### Best Practices:
- Type code yourself (don't copy-paste)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Test your code frequently
- Keep it simple at first

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" Error
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install flask requests
```

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -i :5000
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change the port in the code
app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
```

### Database Locked
```bash
# Close all connections or delete the database file
rm /tmp/learning.db
```
